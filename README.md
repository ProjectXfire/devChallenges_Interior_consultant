<h1 align="center">Interior Consultant</h1>

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This page show a responsive interior consultant web, using HTML, CSS and JS.
The most challenge for this was create the hamburger menu, capturing the size of the view to show this, adding an animation when you click the hamburguer menu.
For the card I have used CSS Position.
For the the diferents container, menu bar and the content, I have used flex instead of grid.
